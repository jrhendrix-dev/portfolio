    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m Jonathan Hendrix, a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> based in Seville, Spain. After several years of experience in administrative and operations roles, I transitioned into software development to combine my problem-solving mindset with a passion for technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        I specialize in building scalable and maintainable web applications using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>MySQL</strong>. My background gives me a unique perspective on how to bridge technical solutions with business needs, and I enjoy working on clean, efficient code that solves real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm fluent in English and Spanish, and I'm currently open to junior developer opportunities or internships that allow me to grow within a collaborative, high-quality engineering environment.
